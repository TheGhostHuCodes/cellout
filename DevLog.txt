This is a somewhat loose, freeform set of notes I made while working.
Occasionally I go through and cleanup these notes, since not all of them are
very useful.

ideas:
[ ] look at some nbconvert stuff for functionality
[ ] executable traversal (writing back to the code cell output)
[ ] command-line spellchecking facility?
[ ] wrapped (kanten-style) notebook presentation?
[ ] interactive mode with live preview  for size and content?
[ ] metadata editor
[ ] selecting only cells matching a tag, or filtering them out
[ ] interactive cell-level editing marking/tagging
[ ] nbformat fuzzing tool?

output as ->
[x] executable script
[x] code only (filter codecell and strip output)
[x] markdown
[ ] notebook

[x] current serialization doesn't match nbformat:
     Unreadable Notebook: C:\bbg\jlabremix\tmp\hi.ipynb AttributeError('cell_type',)
[ ] when you have more than one execute_count output in a code cell, which one should be shown? all?
[x] Unreadable Notebook: C:\bbg\jlabremix\tmp\hi.ipynb UnboundLocalError("local variable 'newcell' referenced before assignment",)
[ ] probably remove the nbformat major/minor from the Notebook model and
    have some mixin that does that at the end (most filters won't care about nbformat version)

from Anthony:
    multiparameter type classes --
    threadscope...
typeclasses - Show Eq -- Functor Traversable Applicative Monoid Monad
import Data.List hiding filter  -- from Anthony

[x] add command-line parsing
[ ] pandoc integration?

2018-10-12
[ ] upstream: execution_count redundancy at the cell and output level

2018-10-17
[ ] separate input and output in different lists /  storage structures
what was my thought about each cell having its own ID - oh, right, storing
all of the text up front so you can edit it that way and then rejoin/resplit
it up (but allows for saving of output)

*Main Data.Aeson.Types> :set -XOverloadedStrings
> decode "{}"  :: Maybe Value
Just (Object (fromList []))
> decode "{\"a\":1}"  :: Maybe Value
Just (Object (fromList [("a",Number 1.0)]))

2018-10-19
[x] strip output as the initial use case with IO

2018-10-22
[ ] readNotebook >>> writeNotebook >>> ( reformat using nbconvert?) >>> diff with original
    ^-- is to gauge what we're dropping on the floor right now, so we
        eventually get to dropping nothing at all
[ ] add flags for --strip-output, for example, do do noop cellout

# roundtrip gaps
[x] Execution count missing from In[ ] section
[x] output stream text missing
[x] encoding conversion for streams

2018-11-02
[x] --readonly / --read-only flags (no output - useful for )
[x] --summary (number of cells, broken down by type, how many executed)
[ ] do we need some sort of executor abstraction down the line?

2018-11-06
[ ] should we convert "source": [ "" ] to just "source": []?
[x] match up to reordered keys and whitespace for cleared output

2018-11-26
[x] rework stream
[ ] replicate newline behavior for multiple source strings?
[x] preserve notebook metadata

2018-11-27
[x] run `jq -S --indent 1` until I get the pretty printing figured out

2018-12-17
[x] better error message when failing to read notebook

Using bash auto-completion
Every program using optparse-applicative gets hidden arguments to support bash
auto-completion. For your own personal use, you run this or add it this to your
.bashrc:

eval "$(myprog --bash-completion-script myprog)"
To install the bash completion system-wide, put the output of
--bash-completion-script where your system looks for it. For example, on Ubuntu:

myprog --bash-completion-script myprog >/etc/bash_completion.d/myprog)

[ ] - accept multiple filenames? ?

2018-12-21
[ ] command line tag filtering
[ ] --cell-tags added to summary
[ ] --list-cell-tags?

can't get alternative parsing to work... so taking a different tack:

	modifyFailure :: (String -> String) -> Parser a -> Parser a

	If the inner Parser failed, modify the failure message using the provided
	function. This allows you to create more descriptive error messages. For
	example:

	parseJSON (Object o) = modifyFailure
		("Parsing of the Foo value failed: " ++)
		(Foo <$> o .: "someField")


	parserThrowError :: JSONPath -> String -> Parser a

	Throw a parser error with an additional path.

	parserCatchError :: Parser a -> (JSONPath -> String -> Parser a) -> Parser a

	A handler function to handle previous errors and return to normal execution.


object [T.pack "worksheets" .= ([] :: [Value])]
parse nbformat3Parser it

monoidal thoughts: having the common cell content be a monoid kind of makes
sense, you can always merge multiple cells together... but what should the type
be of two cells when you merge them (if they are not the same?)
